# Ditto CLI

The Ditto CLI helps teams integrate [Ditto](https://dittowords.com/) into their build processes. You can use it to pull copy  into your codebase using the Ditto API right from the terminal.

Ditto allows for end-to-end syncing of text from mockups (Figma) all the way to production. For more information, visit [dittowords.com](http://dittowords.com).

## Getting Started

Install the Ditto CLI globally by doing the following:

```json
npm install -g @dittowords/cli
```

Then, run `ditto` to finish setting up. You’ll be prompted to:

1. Provide your API key (found at [https://beta.dittowords.com/account/user](https://beta.dittowords.com/account/user) under **API Keys**).
2. Choose a Ditto project in your workspace to pull copy from. Only projects with **developer mode** enabled are accessible via the API.

Once you successfully provide that information, you’re ready to start fetching copy! You can set up the CLI in multiple directories by running the `ditto` command and choosing a project to sync from.

## Commands

### `pull`

**Usage:** `ditto pull`

**Action:** To pull the latest text from the linked project into `ditto/text.json`.

The text will be pulled down as a structured JSON with IDs, and will locally overwrite what was previously in the file.

### `project`

**Usage:** `ditto project`

**Action:** To change the Ditto project you want to pull copy from in the current directory. Running this will allow you to select a project from a list of projects in your workspace that have developer mode enabled.

The Ditto project that the directory is synced with is defined in  `ditto/config.yml`, and you can also manually change the linked project there.

## Files

### `ditto/`

This folder is associated with your current working directory, so if you switch directories, we'll create a new folder there.

- `config.yml`

    This stores the information on which Ditto project you've selected to pull copy from in this directory.

    You can change which project is defined here using the `project` command, or by manually replacing the contents of this file. If you switch directories, you'll automatically be prompted to choose a project to pull from.

- `text.json`

    The copy pulled from your Ditto project is saved to this file. Learn more about how this content is structured and how the IDs are generated by reading our guide here [LINK].

### `.config/ditto`

Your API key is saved to this file in your **root directory**. To change your API key, you'll need to open this file and replace the key manually.

## SDKs

Our SDKs make it easy to integrate the copy pulled from the Ditto CLI into your applications.

- [Ditto React SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ditto-react) for React applications. Allows for easy querying of text, blocks, frames, and more.
